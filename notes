Terraform is infrastructure as code

Why use it:
- Simplicity in keeping track of infrastructure
- Easier collaboration: it is a  file, you can push it to github for others to access
- It is reproducible
- Ensure resources are removed-  one quick command and all resources are brought down and you are not further charged for it

You cannot
- manage and update code on infrastructure
- change immutable resources
- manage resources not defined in your terraform file
