Terraform is infrastructure as code

Why use it:
- Simplicity in keeping track of infrastructure
- Easier collaboration: it is a  file, you can push it to github for others to access
- It is reproducible
- Ensure resources are removed-  one quick command and all resources are brought down and you are not further charged for it

You cannot
- manage and update code on infrastructure
- change immutable resources
- manage resources not defined in your terraform file

Providers
- are code that allow terraform to communicate to manage resources on --> AWS, GCP, Azure, Kubernetes, etc

Key Terraform Commands
Init - get the providers I need
Plan - what am i about to do?
Apply - do what is in the .tf files
Destroy - remove everything defined in the .tf files
